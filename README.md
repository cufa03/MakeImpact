1. I develop everything in ReactJs using JavaScript and Sass. 
2. When you are in the browser you need to **Inspect** the page and then you need to **Toggle device toolbar** and put dimensions for **Iphone 12 Pro**
3. I didn't create any button to move forward or backward in the page. So you need to type the differents urls to watch the views which are: 
- http://localhost:3000/
- http://localhost:3000/description
- http://localhost:3000/sectorCompanies
- http://localhost:3000/sectors
